## 1. Overview
“Furuta Pendulum – or rotational inverted pendulum- consists of a driven arm which rotates in the
horizontal plane and a pendulum attached to that arm which is free to rotate in the vertical plane. It was
invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues.” [1] The
problem that the team investigates with this project is creating a test platform for control system
algorithms -in a low-cost and streamlined fashion. In that regard, the project team is expected to create
a mathematical model of the system with a designed control system.

Deliverables:
- The team is expected to present their project (~ 5mins) and build a web page which contains all
  deliverables in GitHub.
- The mathematical model of the system must be delivered -preferably in Python or MATLAB.
- The control system should be provided preferable in Simulink, State-flow, or with a high-level
  programming language (e.g., C, C++, or Python). However, the team must show that the control
  algorithm will give the design requirements for the target system. In other words, one cannot
  build the system solely hands-on approach similar to the videos below:
  o Pan and Tilt Mechanism
- The system will have a simulation with the control system and mathematical model by
  connecting Coppelia Sim to MATLAB, Simulink, or whatever the programming landscape is used.
- If the system contains hardware, the design of hardware should consist the necessary
  architectural explanations such as hardware and software relationships.
